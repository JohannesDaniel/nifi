<h2>Usage Example</h2>

<p>
    This processor queries Solr and writes results to FlowFiles. The processor can be used at the
    beginning of dataflows and later. Solr results can be written to FlowFiles as Solr XML or using
    records functions (supporting CSV, JSON, etc.). Additionally, facets and stats can be retrieved.
    They are written to FlowFiles in JSON and sent to designated relationships. Furthermore, the
    processor can either be configured to retrieve only top results or full result sets.
</p>

<p>
    Parameters that can be set multiple times have to be defined as dynamic properties (e. g. fq,
    facet.field, stats.field). If these parameters must be set multiple times with different values,
    properties can follow a naming convention:
    name.number, where name is the parameter name and number is a unique number.
    Repeating parameters will be sorted by their property name.
</p>

<p>
    Example: Defining the fq parameter multiple times
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Property Name</th>
        <th>Property Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>fq.1</td>
        <td><code>field1:value1</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>fq.2</td>
        <td><code>field2:value2</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>fq.3</td>
        <td><code>field3:value3</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    This definition will be appended to the Solr URL as follows:
    fq=field1:value1&fq=field2:value2&fq=field3:value3
